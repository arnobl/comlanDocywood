Protocol are used to named external components, that will not lead to code generation by compilers. They may however be used by plugins. Typically used for network transmissions. Additional information must be provided with annotation in most cases. `name` must be defined. The expected format is an identifier.
Type `protocol`. 

Then, give the value, here: `UDP `.
