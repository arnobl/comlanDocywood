The thing is a central concept in ThingML. It models a component that can be instanciated in a configuration. It may include a statemachine, ports, messages, properties, functions. It can be a whole thing or a fragment. A fragment is a thing that can not be instanciated but rather be included in another thing. The name must be defined. The expected format is an identifier.
Type `thing`. 

Then, give the value, here: `TestArrays4 `.


Type `{`. 

Type `}`.
